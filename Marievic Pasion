Being a Single Mom is lot of happening in My life, I'm a mother of 2 year old boy, My son is my greastest achievement in my life, He is also My answered prayer to the lord.
Everyday in My life I learn new thing specially to My son. It's so challenging but it fun.
To provide the need of my son I have  small online shop I sell used clother thu live selling every morning. I'm so multitasking for that.
Right now I'm so worried to my son because he speaks so limited, but by the support of other and positive people around me i'm getting a courage for them. 
I let go to all the people that is so negative in life and judging My son, It's so hard but I need to be strong for my Son.
Sometime I crying alone because of my situation but I know God is there he did'nt gave this situation to me just to surrender. I know God gave this because I can handle it...
